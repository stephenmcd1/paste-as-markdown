# Paste as Markdown

## Features

### Summary

When pasting formatted text (copied from Word for example) into simple `<textarea />` elements, all the formatting is lost.  However, if the textarea support Markdown syntax, this extension can help by converting the formatting into comparable Markdown syntax as you paste.

### Picture time

As an example, say you have something like this copied on your clipboard:

![Formatted Text with a Link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stephenmcd1/paste-as-markdown/master/assets/FormattedTextWithLink.png)

If you then try to paste that into a comment in Trello, you'll be sad when you see:

![Pasting as Plain Text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stephenmcd1/paste-as-markdown/master/assets/PastePlainText.png)

But with this extension, you'll be happy when you see:

### Limitations

Currently this extension only supports pasting into Trello and only formats links (`<a href=... />`).  More web sites and formatting can always be added as needed.  My immediate need was for links in Trello so that's where I started.
